# Decentralized Sustainable Forestry Certification

This project implements a blockchain-based system for verifying and certifying sustainable forestry practices. The platform creates an immutable, transparent record of forest management activities and wood products, enabling stakeholders throughout the supply chain to verify sustainability claims and ensuring fair compensation for responsible forest stewards.

## Core Components

1. **Forest Management Contract**
    - Records sustainable harvesting practices and management plans
    - Maintains verifiable history of forest stewardship activities
    - Tracks replanting efforts and biodiversity conservation measures
    - Creates auditable compliance records for regulatory purposes

2. **Timber Tracking Contract**
    - Monitors wood products from forest harvest to final consumer goods
    - Creates immutable chain of custody throughout the supply chain
    - Prevents counterfeit sustainability claims through cryptographic validation
    - Enables consumers to verify the source of wood products

3. **Certification Verification Contract**
    - Validates compliance with established sustainability standards
    - Manages verification processes by accredited third-party auditors
    - Creates transparent record of certification status and history
    - Reduces administrative costs for certification management

4. **Carbon Sequestration Contract**
    - Quantifies climate benefits of maintained and improved forests
    - Calculates carbon credits based on verified sequestration data
    - Creates marketplace for trading forestry-based carbon offsets
    - Ensures appropriate compensation for forest climate services
